## ideas for future version:

small button on side for "find my iphone" feature... 

put small trackpad on corner of mirror for controls

put speakers in top corners of mirror for playback options (podcasts, music, etc)

put distance sensor in bottom of mirror to control compliments (every time you step back in front of the mirror, it pops a new compliment)

mayyyybbeeee (pending wife's approval, she said no but i think it's thuper kewl): pull out keyboard for even more control.
