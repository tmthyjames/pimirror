## ideas for future version:

small button on side for "find my iphone" feature... 

wireless qwerty keyboard with trackpad

put speakers in top corners of mirror for playback options (podcasts, music, etc)

put distance sensor in bottom of mirror to control compliments (every time you step back in front of the mirror, it pops a new compliment)

mayyyybbeeee (pending wife's approval, she said no but i think it's thuper kewl): pull out keyboard for even more control.

## dimensions:

one-way glass: 34 3/4 X 19 1/2 inches ($120 at madison glass company)
